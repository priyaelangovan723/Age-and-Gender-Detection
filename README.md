The upgrading of image pictures taken from the camera sources, from satellites, aeroplanes, and the images caught in everyday lives is called picture processing. Processing of the image based on analysis undergoes many different techniques and calculations. Digital formed pictures need to be carefully imagined and studies.

Image processing has two main steps followed by simple steps. The improvement of an image with the end goal of more good quality pictures; that can be adopted by other programs are called picture upgrades. The other procedure is the most pursued strategy utilized for the extraction of data from a picture. The division of images into certain parts is called segmentation.
